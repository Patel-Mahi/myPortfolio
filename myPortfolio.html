            </h1>
            <p>
                I am Mahi Patel, a High School student about to graduate on June 6, 2024. 
                I have experience in customer service because I worked as a cashier at Gerrity's Supermarkets. 
                I like helping people and show them that the right way which can save their time and effort. 
                As a cashier, I had to help customers with what they needed in a friendly way to have 
                good rating for their store and making sure that the customer visits again.
                I can help customers with any problems they would have and I am also a very patient and calm person.
